## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts
2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to mage pages by creating a new `.astro`file by placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.
3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro Pages and Markdown posts!

## What' next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
